     to: current
   title: CoreMotion Senior Manager
   description:
   - Led the Activity Team on CoreMotion
   -
    - Mentored and guided developer/scientists, drove schedules, and worked cross functionally to ship the following features
    - Activity Classification / Step Counter on all variants of the Apple Motion Coprocessor
    - Find My Car, Do Not Disturb While Driving, Workout Start/Stop Alerts, Sensor data collection for Health User Studies
   - Architected a system that powered the Move/Exercise rings and Workouts experience for the Apple Watch.
   - Made system deterministic for simulation, abstracted unreliable and latent inputs for ease of use, and allowed the team to work in parallel in shipping the feature
   - Designed/developed a solution to collect all day sensor data (CMSensorRecorder) in a power efficient manner and was a foundation to building out large scale user studies.
   - Encouraged a culture to find ways to build ever more robust software.  Participated extensively in book clubs, code reviews, and design reviews.
   - Cultivated lasting internal and cross functional partnerships by being transparent and respectful in the pursuit of mutually beneficial goals.

 - company: Pacific Biosciences
   location: Menlo Park, CA
   date:
    from: 2010
    to: 2012
   title: Software Engineer
   description:
   - Responsible for the robot and machine vision software for a genetic sequencing instrument.
   - Developed application software using C# and NUnit, using both Visual Studio and Linux.  Debugged embedded Linux applications written in C++.  Developed manufacturing, field service, and testing scripts using Python.
   - Eliminated a major source of chip pick up failures by identifying and fixing a critical machine vision transformation that incorrectly calculated the pose of the stage from which our robot was attempting to pick up a chip.
   - Improved robustness to imaging variations for a fiducial detection and positioning algorithm by applying additional constraints to minimally select and enhance edges using morphology together with sharpening filters.
   - Simplified and refactored the interlock publisher-subscriber system for correct behavior.  Improved software response times by reducing unnecessary synchroniztion between status updates and the status update responses.

 - company: Direct Electron
   location: San Diego, CA
   date:
     from: 2010
     to: 2010
   title: Independent
   description:
   - Developed the Direct Electron microscope client in C++, and Visual Studio.  Used Boost ASIO for TCP/IP communication to the server and Google Protocol Buffers for data serialization.  Ported client to Linix platforms using GNU Autotools.
   - Developed the LiveFFT plugin for ImageJ in Java to dynamically update an image's FFT transform as it is updated (during image acquisition).

 - company: FreightScan Cargo
   location: San Diego, CA
   date:
     from: 2007
     to: 2009
   title: Senior Software Engineer
   description:
   - Responsible for the machine vision algorithm development for a cargo dimensioning system using C++.
   - Developed an interactive 3D point cloud viewer to visualize scans and inspect data points generated from a time of flight scanner using Microsoft XNA.
   - Improved measurement results by developing an algorithm to identify and eliminate false data points created in the shadows of objects. Â Shadow detection was implemented by finding sets of points that formed a line collinear with the incident ray from the camera.
   - Implemented a motion detection algorithm to trigger automatic system scans using OpenCV and DirectShow using image differences.
   - Designed  an observer pattern based, client-server communication layer using .NET Remoting.

 - company: Alibaba
   location: Hanzhou, China
   date:

   title: Product Developer
   description:
   - Coordinated regional US and Hong Kong marketing operations from China headquarters.
   - Jointly developed overseas online marketing programs and bridged language communications.

 - company: University of California San Diego
   location: San Diego, CA
   date:
     from: 2001
     to: 2006
   title: Engineer
   description:
   - Enabled the visualization of neurodegenerative disorders by creating an automated system to acquire and assemble gigapixel images of mouse brains.
   - Utilized the combination of Microsoft Visual C++, MFC and COM to synchronize stepper motor movements with image acquisition.
   - Engineered a non-uniform illumination correction and image alignment solution in a memory efficient manner with Eclipse and Java Advanced Imaging libraries.
   - Collaborated with Olympus engineers to develop commercial automated mosaic systems.
