   title: CoreMotion Senior Manager
   description:
   - Led a multidisciplinary team and worked cross functionally to ship the features (iOS 6.0+, watchOS 1.0+) including the following
   -
    - Activity classification/Pedometer on all variants of the Apple Motion Coprocessor
    - Vehicular detection for Find My Car, Do Not Disturb While Driving
    - Workout detection for Automatic Workout Start/Stop Alerts
   - Architected a system that unified the computation of Move, Exercise and Workouts metrics for the Apple Watch. Designed system to be deterministic for simulation, abstracted lossy and latent inputs for ease of use, and allowed the team to work in parallel in shipping the features.
   - Designed/developed a solution for all day sensor data recording (CMSensorRecorder).  This was a foundation to building out large scale user studies.
   - Encouraged a culture of building better software.  Participated in book clubs, code reviews, and design reviews.

   title: Software Engineer
   description:
   - Responsible for the robot and machine vision software for a genetic sequencing instrument using with C#, python, and C++
   - Worked with software, systems, field service, and factory teams to practively identify and address instrument software reliability issues.
   - Eliminated a major source of chip pick up failures by identifying and fixing a critical machine vision transformation that incorrectly calculated the pose of the stage from which our robot was attempting to pick up a chip.

     to: 2009
   title: Senior Software Engineer
   description:
   - Designed an observer pattern based, client-server communication layer using .NET Remoting.
   - Designed machine vision algorithms for a cargo dimensioning system using C++.  Improved measurement results by developing an algorithm to identify and eliminate false data points created in the shadows of objects.  Shadow detection was implemented by finding sets of points that formed a line collinear with the incident ray from the camera.
   - Developed an interactive 3D point cloud viewer to visualize scans and inspect data points generated from a time of flight scanner using Microsoft XNA.
