   title: CoreMotion Senior Manager
   description:
   - title: Motion Algorithm Development Platform
     detail: Adapted non deterministic Objective-C++ code to run deterministically on OSX to enable offline and repeatable simulations. Significantly reduced costs for development, debugging, and validation and increased confidence in shipped software by simulating against large volumes of data.  Utilized the new processes in developing motion algorithms for the M7 motion coprocessor.

   - title: Calorimetry Engine for Apple Watch
     detail: Architected using modern C++ and partitioned the design based on user activity and created interfaces to coordinate control and abstract access to sensor inputs.  Incorporated offline simulations into design for different subteams specialized in calorimetry modeling to minimize algorithm iteration times.

   - title: All Day Sensor Recording
     detail: Increased time window for sensor recording from 6 hours to the entire day by utilizing the motion coprocessor's interface with DRAM to buffer sensor data without waking the application processor.  Enabled more complete diagnostics for internal bug reporting and ultimately to remote data collection capabilities (used to collect data for Fall detection).

   - title: Do Not Disturb While Driving
     detail: Led the motion activity classification team in improving precision/recall for vehicular classification. Coordinated with other wireless teams to create novel notions of vehicular speed to complement accelerometer based classification. Reimplemented the legacy heuristics as a state machine for team to more easily add transitions to integrate new inputs.  Leveraged improvements to simulation and all day sensor recording to further tune activity classification.

   - title: Workout Alerts
     detail: Extended team's data collection and classification expertise into fitness.  Anticipated need for design data and secured senior leadership approval to collect sensor data from users during user initiated workouts.  Engaged Health Data Sciences and Privacy teams for requirements to implement a system to collect and upload data remotely.  Led team in designing a multi-tiered detector + classifier solution to balance tradeoffs between lower powered and always on detection, with higher power and more discriminative sensors for workout classification.
